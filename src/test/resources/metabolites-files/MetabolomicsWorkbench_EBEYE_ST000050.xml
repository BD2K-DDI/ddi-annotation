      <name>Preterm Neonatal Urinary Renal Developmental and acute kidney injury Metabolomic Profiling</name>
      <description>Brophy and Askenazi hypothesize that postnatal renal maturation results in specific identifiable patterns of urinary metabolites and that these profiles will be altered in the presence of AKI.  Their long-term goal is to identify novel metabolomics urinary profiles that can provide real-time evidence of evolving neonatal renal injury thereby allowing earlier diagnosis and treatment.This study includes 40 pre-term infants age 2 days.  Twenty infants were identified as not having AKI (11 females, mean gestational age=182.8 days, mean birth weight=834.0 grams) and 20 infants were identified as having AKI (13 females, mean gestational age=183.9 days, mean birth weight=815.8 grams).   There are no statistical differences between the two groups based on gender, gestational age, and birth weight.</description>
