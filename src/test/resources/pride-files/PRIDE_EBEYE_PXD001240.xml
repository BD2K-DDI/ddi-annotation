      <name>Benchmarking label-free quantification based on data-independent acquisition (DIA) workflows</name>
      <description>Label-free quantification based on data-independent acquisition (DIA) workflows is increasingly popular. Several software tools have been recently published or are commercially available. The present study focuses on the critical evaluation of three different software packages (Progenesis, synapter and ISOQuant) supporting ion-mobility enhanced DIA data. In order to benchmark the label-free quantification performance of the different tools, we generated two hybrid proteome samples of defined quantitative composition containing tryptically digested proteomes of three different species (mouse, yeast, E.coli). This model data set simulates complex biological samples containing large numbers of both unregulated (background) proteins as well as up- and down-regulated proteins with exactly known ratios between samples. We determined the number and dynamic range of quantifiable proteins and analyzed the influence of applied algorithms (retention time alignment, clustering, normalization, etc.) on the variation of reported protein quantities between technical replicates.</description>

        <field name="sample_protocol">Sample preparation. Human cervix carcinoma cell line HeLa was purchased from the German Resource Centre for Biological Material (DSMZ) and cultured as described before [Distler et al., 2104]. Saccharomyces cerevisiae bayanus, strain Lalvin® EC-1118 cells were grown in YPD media as described by Fonslow et al.. Cell lysis and tryptic digestion using a modified FASP protocol were performed as previously described in detail [Distler et al., 2014]. Tryptic digest of E.coli proteins (MassPREPTM standard) was purchased from Waters Corporation.  To generate the two hybrid proteome samples, tryptic peptides were combined in the following ratios: Sample A was composed of 65% (w/w) human, 30% (w/w) yeast and 5% (w/w) E. coli proteins. Sample B was composed of 65% (w/w) human, 15% (w/w) yeast and 20% (w/w) E. coli proteins (Fig. 1a). NanoUPLC-MS analysis. All samples were analyzed by reversed-phase LC-MS using a nanoAcquity UPLC system (Waters Corporation) coupled to a Synapt G2-S HDMS mass spectrometer (Waters Corporation). NanoUPLC separation of tryptic peptides was performed with a nanoAcquity UPLC system (Waters Corporation) equipped with a HSS-T3 C18 1.8 μm, 75 μm x 250 mm analytical reversed-phase column (Waters Corporation) in direct injection mode as described before using 180 min gradients [Distler et al., 2014]. Mass spectrometric analysis of tryptic peptides was performed using a Synapt G2-S HDMS mass spectrometer (Waters Corporation) equipped with a T-Wave-IMS device in MSE and UDMSE-modes as previously described in detail [Distler et al., 2014]. Samples were analyzed in five technical replicates.</field>
        <field name="data_protocol">Data processing workflow. MSE and UDMSE data were processed with three software packages, Progenesis QI for proteomics (64-bit version v1.0; Nonlinear Dynamics/Waters), synapter 1.7.0 and ISOQuant 1.6. Data for each acquisition mode (MSE and UDMSE) were processed both separately and as a combined dataset containing both, MSE and UDMSE data. Common processing steps applied to Progenesis, Synapter and ISOQuant.  Rawdata processing. Raw data were lock mass-corrected using the doubly charged ion of [Glu1]-fibrinopeptide B (m/z 785.8426; [M+2H]2+). For initial peak detection, all software platforms used the same algorithm (Apex3D, Waters Corporation). For Apex3D processing, the following thresholds were applied: (i) low energy ion threshold: 135 counts, (ii) elevated energy ion threshold: 25 counts, (iii) minimal total ion intensity: 750 counts.  Search database. Human, yeast (Lalvin EC1118 strain) and E.coli UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot reference proteomes (downloaded on 2014/02/14; number of entries were as follows: 20,266 proteins (human), 5,982 proteins (yeast) and 4,303 proteins (E.coli)) and common contaminant proteins were merged into a single fasta file. The sequence of each protein entry was reversed to generate a decoy database, which was appended to the original fasta file. Individual parameters for the analyzed software packages. Progenesis. Raw profile data (.raw) were imported into Progenesis QI for proteomics (64-bit version v1.0; Nonlinear Dynamics/Waters). During import, data were lock mass corrected and initial peak detection was performed (see above). Imported runs were aligned to the reference run identified by the software. All runs were selected for peak picking with the most sensitive setting (5) of the automatic sensitivity method. A minimum chromatographic peak width of 0.15 min was applied and the maximum allowable ion charge was set to 6. All detected features were normalized to a normalization reference run identified by the software. Between-subject comparison was used as experimental design. For peptide identification, a MSE search was performed against the combined target-decoy database specified above with the following parameter settings: digest reagent, trypsin; maximum missed cleavages: 2; max protein mass: 2,500 kDa; fixed modifications: carbamidomethyl; variable modifications: deamidation N, deamidation Q, oxidation M. Search tolerance parameters: peptide tolerance, auto; fragment tolerance, auto; FDR &lt; 1 %. Ion matching requirements: 2 fragments/peptide, 5 fragments/protein, 1 peptide/protein. Identifications were refined by removing peptides with a sequence length less than six amino acids and a score less than 4. Default settings (i.e. grouping of similar proteins and quantitation from non-conflicting features only) were used for protein building.  Synapter. Acquired raw data was processed using PLGS (v3.0.2) for signal detection, peak picking, deisotoping and charge-state deconvolution and for protein identification. PLGS searches were performed at 100% FDR. All other search parameters were identical to those described for Progenesis. Raw data processing and database search results were exported in .csv format. Files (.csv) were processed with synapter in R 3.1.0 environment according to author instructions. All files of a project were "synergised" one by one with the corresponding master file using minimum peptide length of 6 amino acids, 1% FDR and 1% FPR settings. Synapter results for each run of a project were exported to a separate folder. Next, proteins entries, calculated TOP3-amounts and corresponding peptide sequences and modifiers were extracted from each single run based synapter result file. For each protein, the number or reported peptides was determined by counting unique peptide sequence and modifier combinations in R 3.1.0 environment.  ISOQuant. Acquired raw data was processed using PLGS (v3.0.2) for signal detection, peak picking, isotope and charge-state deconvolution. For protein identification, PLGS was set to search proteins at 1% FDR using search parameters identical to those described for Progenesis. In MSE and combined projects, ion mobility drift times were ignored for the retention time alignment and EMRT clustering routines. For MSE and UDMSE projects, EMRT intensities were normalized using two-dimensional-in-project normalization. For the combined project a two-dimensional-in-sample normalization approach was used. ISOQuant was set to use peptides identified in at least two runs and composed of minimum six amino acids for EMRT cluster annotation and to drop ambiguously annotated clusters. Peptides identified in first PLGS database searching pass and reaching scores greater than or equal to 5.5 were used for protein quantification. Only proteins reported by two and more peptides were quantified using the TOP3 method. FPR for both peptides and proteins was set to 1% based on the annotated cluster table.</field>
