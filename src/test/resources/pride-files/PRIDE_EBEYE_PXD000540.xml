      <name>Wheat leaf phosphoproteome</name>
      <description>In this study, we performed a large-scale leaf phosphoproteomic analysis of two wheat  genotypes HX10 and NC47 to explore the complex protein phosphorylation network of signaling and regulatory events affecting rapid vegetative growth in wheat. We used TiO2 affinity chromatography combined with LC-MS/MS and Maxquant software to identify phosphopeptides and phosphorylated sites. Finally, 2,336 phosphopeptides containing 2,734 phosphorylation sites were  identified from the two wheat genotypes HX10 and NC47 in our study.</description>

        <field name="sample_protocol">Seeds of HX10 and NC47 bread wheat cultivars, which are recently released elite bread wheat cultivars in Northern China, were surface-sterilized in 5% sodium hypochlorite for 5 min and rinsed four times in sterile distilled water. After submersion in water for 12 h at room temperature, the seeds were transferred to a wet filter paper to germinate at room temperature (22–25 °C) for 24 h. For each of the two bread wheat cultivars, 300 uniformly germinated seeds were selected and grown in each of the three plastic pots containing Hoagland’s solution, which was changed every 2 d. Wheat seedlings were cultured with three biological replicates. At the three-leaf stage, all three leaves of the seedlings were collected and frozen at −80 °C prior to analysis.</field>
        <field name="data_protocol">The raw files were processed with MaxQuant (version 1.2.2.5) and searched against the wheat protein database (77 037 entries) concatenated with a decoy consisting of reversed sequences. The following parameters were used for database searches: cysteine carbamidomethylation was selected as a fixed modification; methionine oxidation, protein N-terminal acetylation, and phosphorylation on Ser, Thr, and Tyr were selected as variable modifications. Up to two missing cleavage points were allowed. The precursor ion mass tolerances were 7 ppm, and the fragment ion mass tolerance for the MS/MS spectra was 0.5 Da. The false discovery rate (FDR) was set to &lt;1.0% for both peptide and protein identifications, and the minimum peptide length was set to 6.</field>
